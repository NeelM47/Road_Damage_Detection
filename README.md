# Road Damage Detection and Alert System

## Overview

The Road Damage Detection and Alert System uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify road damage from images. The system automatically sends alerts to users via a messaging service when damage is detected. This project aims to enhance road safety and maintenance efficiency by providing timely notifications about road conditions.

## Features

- **Road Damage Detection:** Utilizes CNNs to analyze and detect road damage from images.
- **Classification:** Classifies the type and severity of damage.
- **User Alerts:** Sends real-time alerts to users through a messaging service (e.g., SMS, email).
- **Dashboard:** Provides a web-based dashboard for viewing detected damage and alerts.
